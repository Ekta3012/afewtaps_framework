	<p style="text-align:center; font-size:44px; padding-bottom: 30px;">Introduction to <strong>afewtaps.</strong></p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize">Dated: 16 December, 2016</p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize">First of all, we are happy to introduce <strong>afewtaps</strong> post demonetisation.</p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize">On the 9th of November 2016, the Indian government, delivered a masterstroke, by announcing, as illegal tender, the ₹500/- and ₹1000/- denominations in the currency system. This was truly a bold move and dealt a blow to the very heart of corruption.
	Keeping up with the trend sweeping across the country, the main contribution of demonetisation is going to be the setup of
	<b>ethical</b> business practices.</p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize">Restauranteurs and entrepreneurs need to use this time to ensure a clean front-end and back-end operations, to bring in more transparency and to ensure a wide-spread use of technology to operate efficiently.</p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize">Restaurant Technology Survey 2016 shows that restaurant operators agree technology can help increase sales, enhance
	customer service and offer a competitive advantage. However, “barriers to implementation” hamper progress and lead a third of
	restaurant operators to say their operations are lagging in tech use. Only about 1 in 10 believe their establishment is leading
	edge. Certain barriers to implementation such as cost, infrastructure and customer acceptance are some of the things software
	providers need to look into.</p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize">While delivering technology, we are already working towards having a counter effect on these “barriers to implementation”, such as easy infrastructure setup with easier to use interface while developing new technologies to attract customers. Get in
	touch with us and we will be happy to discuss.</p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize" style="color:#367da5;">What we offer to restaurants, cafes and multiplexes?</p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize" style="color:#367da5;">- a smartphone app for customers to <strong>place orders</strong>  with.(not for home delivery)</p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize" style="color:#367da5;">- a <strong>tablet</strong> to <strong>receive</strong> all incoming customer orders.</p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize" style="color:#367da5;">- <strong>smartphone(s)</strong> for full service restaurants and cafes to take customer orders with (verbal orders).<strong>(Hand-held POS devices)</strong></p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize" style="color:#367da5;">- <strong>Connecting</strong> our software with the establishment <strong>Point of Sale</strong> for smooth flow of transactions.</p>
	<p class="theblogfontsize" style="color:#578726;"><strong>Long-term benefits of what we offer?</strong></p>

	<ul>


	<li class="theblogfontsize" style="color:#578726;">Avoids the discomfort customers feel today during peaks hours, while looking for staff attention. Our software offers your customer an additional choice to place an order.</li>
	<li class="theblogfontsize" style="color:#578726;">Provides the restaurant with a secondary POS in the form of a tablet, for incoming customer orders, the only difference is, customer orders are automatically entered here, unlike the primary restaurant POS, where items need to be manually entered.The secondary POS also helps in assisting the primary POS with automatic order entry, to save time, and reduce physical labor,
	to make the restaurant faster and smarter.</li>
	<li class="theblogfontsize" style="color:#578726;">Avoids the use of pen, paper to take customer orders and manual POS entry and allows the staff to take orders right from a smartphone, along with one-tap POS entries, to serve faster, improve table-turns while being more available to customers.</li>

	</ul>
